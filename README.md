# hermes-ws
A very simple (and quite bad lol) barebones web server written in C. Utilizes the WinSock2 API.

## Features
- It doesn't crash
- Can serve static HTML + CSS pages

## Todo
- Cleanup code (Sort of done?...)
- Fix image serving (Seems to be working... kind of...)
- Implement an LRU cache (Works so far, needs tweaking)
